-[x] NAME:ADAPTIVE CODEBASE ANALYSIS REQUEST - CONTEXT-FIRST APPROACH USING ALL MCP TOOLS DESCRIPTION:**CRITICAL**: Use all available MCP servers to understand existing patterns and constraints BEFORE applying any changes  **MCP-POWERED DISCOVERY PHASE**: 1. **Sequential-Thinking MCP**: Systematically analyze codebase structure, patterns, and conventions 2. **Task-Manager MCP**: Create structured analysis and improvement pipeline 3. **Context7 MCP**: Maintain comprehensive understanding across all project files 4. **Memory MCP**: Save analysis findings, constraint documentation, and improvement plans 5. **Web-Search MCP**: Research best practices relevant to discovered tech stack and patterns  **Context-Aware Strategy Using MCP Tools**: - ✅ **Apply solutions that ENHANCE the existing ecosystem** - ❌ **Don't impose changes that disrupt working systems** - 🔄 **Evolve gradually** where beneficial, avoid unnecessary disruption - 📋 **Document decisions** with clear contextual reasoning using Memory MCP  **Smart Improvement Areas (Execute via MCP Tools)**: - **Refactoring**: Use Sequential-Thinking to identify refactoring opportunities, Task-Manager to prioritize - **Deduplication**: Systematically find and remove redundant code, consolidate duplicate functions/components - **Build Optimization**: Fix compilation errors, resolve dependency conflicts using available development tools - **Performance**: Eliminate bottlenecks, optimize resource usage based on Context7 analysis - **Maintainability**: Simplify complex logic, improve readability - **Error Handling**: Add robust error management without breaking current flows - **Testing**: Enhance test coverage while respecting existing test patterns - **Documentation**: Improve code comments and project documentation, save to Memory MCP  **MCP Execution Workflow**: 1. **Sequential-Thinking MCP**: Analyze entire codebase systematically 2. **Task-Manager MCP**: Create prioritized improvement tasks based on analysis 3. **Context7 MCP**: Track relationships between components during refactoring 4. **Web-Search MCP**: Research solutions for identified issues and patterns 5. **Memory MCP**: Document all findings, decisions, and implementation guides 6. **Available Development MCPs**: Execute actual code improvements, build fixes, and optimizations  **Smart Evolution Principles**: 1. **Harmony > Idealism** - Use Context7 to ensure changes fit existing ecosystem 2. **Value > Convention** - Use Sequential-Thinking to prioritize actual benefits 3. **People > Process** - Consider maintenance team capabilities via comprehensive analysis 4. **Progress > Purity** - Use Task-Manager for incremental improvement planning 5. **Safety First** - Don't break working functionality in pursuit of cleaner code 6. **Measure Impact** - Document improvements and results in Memory MCP  **Execution Priorities (Task-Manager Structure)**: 1. **Fix Critical Issues First** - Build errors, security vulnerabilities, breaking bugs 2. **Remove Safe Redundancies** - Obvious duplicates that don't affect functionality 3. **Refactor High-Impact Areas** - Code touched frequently by the team 4. **Optimize Bottlenecks** - Performance issues that actually matter to users 5. **Improve Developer Experience** - Tools and patterns that help the team work better  **EXECUTE NOW**: Start with Sequential-Thinking analysis of the codebase, use Task-Manager to structure improvements, leverage all available MCP tools to implement changes, and save everything to Memory MCP for documentation.  Begin comprehensive analysis using all MCP servers, then execute the complete improvement
