# Code Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to remove redundant, duplicate, and unused code from the project.

## CSS Files Cleanup

### 1. Deprecated Redundant Form Styles
- **File**: `src/styles/components/forms.css`
- **Changes**: Deprecated the file and removed all form-related CSS classes (.form-input, .form-label, .form-select, etc.) since they are now implemented in dedicated UI components
- **Reason**: Avoiding duplication between CSS classes and UI components

### 2. Removed Unused Utility Classes
- **File**: `src/styles/utilities/index.css`
- **Changes**: Removed unused utility classes including:
  - Scroll reveal classes (.scroll-reveal, .scroll-reveal-left, etc.)
  - Hover animation classes (.hover-lift, .hover-glow, .hover-scale)
  - Container query classes (.container-query, .container-card, etc.)
  - Container query responsive classes (.cq-sm:block, .cq-md:flex, etc.)
- **Reason**: These classes were not used anywhere in the project

### 3. Optimized Critical CSS
- **File**: `public/assets/css/critical.css`
- **Changes**: Removed redundant button styles (.btn, .btn-primary, .btn-secondary)
- **Reason**: Using dedicated UI components instead of CSS classes

## Component Files Cleanup

- **Reason**: Directory was empty

### 2. Removed Unused Component Directories
- **Directory**: `src/components/forms`

### 3. Removed Additional Empty Directories
- **Directory**: `public/scripts`

- **Directory**: `src/styles/base`

- **Directory**: `src/styles/pages`
- **Reason**: Directory was empty and unused

### 4. Removed Unused UI Components
- **Components**: 
  - Accordion component (`src/components/ui/accordion.tsx`)
  - Modal component (`src/components/ui/modal.tsx`)
  - Breadcrumb component (`src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx`)
  - Tabs component (`src/components/ui/tabs.tsx`)
  - Tooltip component (`src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx`)
  - AnimatedElement component (`src/components/ui/AnimatedElement.tsx`)
  - Toaster component (`src/components/ui/Toaster.tsx`)
- **Reason**: These components were not imported or used anywhere in the project

## Component Consolidation

### 1. Error Boundary Components
- **Action**: Removed duplicate implementation
- **Details**: 
  - Deleted `src/components/ui/error-boundary.tsx` (duplicate)
  - Updated imports to use `UnifiedErrorBoundary` from `src/components/error/UnifiedErrorBoundary.tsx`
  - Updated usage in `BookingWizard.tsx` and `UnifiedContactForm.tsx`

## Import Updates

### 1. Verified Unified Component Usage
- **Result**: All components are already using the unified component pattern
- **Components**: UI components from `src/components/ui/` are properly imported and used

## Verification

All CSS classes and components that were removed were verified to be unused in the project by searching through all files. The remaining CSS files and components are properly organized and do not contain duplicates.

The project structure is now cleaner with reduced bundle size and improved maintainability.

## Additional Improvements

1. **Removed Empty Directories**: Cleaned up several empty directories that were not being used
2. **Maintained Unified Component Pattern**: Ensured all new development follows the unified component pattern
3. **Component Consolidation**: Removed duplicate implementations in favor of comprehensive unified components
4. **No Breaking Changes**: All cleanup was done without affecting existing functionality

This cleanup improves the overall maintainability of the codebase and reduces the bundle size by removing unused code.
