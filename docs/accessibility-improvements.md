# Accessibility Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the accessibility improvements made to the Nosyt Labs website to address critical accessibility issues identified in our audit.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Color Contrast Issues
**Problem**: Elements did not meet minimum color contrast ratio thresholds (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
**Solution**: 
- Updated CSS color variables in `src/styles/global.css` to ensure proper contrast
- Darkened text colors and lightened background colors where needed
- Adjusted primary accent colors to maintain brand identity while improving accessibility
- Modified both light and dark mode color schemes

**Files Modified**:
- `src/styles/global.css` - Updated color variables for better contrast
- `src/components/ui/Button.astro` - Updated button colors for better contrast

### 2. List Structure Issues
**Problem**: 
- `<ul>` and `<ol>` elements contained direct children that were not `<li>`, `<script>`, or `<template>` elements
- `<li>` elements were not properly contained within `<ul>` or `<ol>` elements
**Solution**:
- Fixed semantic HTML structure in `src/pages/services.astro`
- Ensured all list items are properly nested within their parent list elements
- Corrected closing tags and indentation for better code readability

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/services.astro` - Fixed list structure issues

### 3. HTML Entity Encoding Issues
**Problem**: Incorrect HTML entities in the header section of the services page
**Solution**: Fixed HTML entity encoding issues by correcting improperly escaped characters

**Files Modified**:
- `src/pages/services.astro` - Fixed HTML entity encoding

## Visual Design Improvements
