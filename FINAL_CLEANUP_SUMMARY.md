# Final Code Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the final cleanup work performed on the NosytLabs codebase to remove redundant, duplicate, and unused code, CSS, and files.

## 1. Removed Empty Directories

The following empty directories have been removed from the codebase:

- `src/content/blog` - Empty content directory
- `src/content/projects` - Empty content directory

## 2. Removed Unused CSS Classes

Several CSS utility classes that were marked as unused have been removed from `src/styles/utilities/index.css`:

### Removed CSS Classes:
- **Scroll Reveal Animations** - All scroll reveal classes marked as "not used in project"
- **Staggered Animations** - All stagger-children classes:
  - `.stagger-children > *`
  - `.stagger-children.revealed > *`
  - `.stagger-children.revealed > *:nth-child(1)` through `:nth-child(6)`
- **Hover Animations** - All hover animation classes marked as "not used in project"
- **Container Query Utilities** - All container query classes marked as "not used in project"
- **Named Containers** - All named container classes marked as "not used in project"
- **Container Query Responsive Classes** - All container query responsive classes marked as "not used in project"

## 3. Benefits of Final Cleanup

1. **Further Reduced Bundle Size**: Removal of unused CSS classes reduces the overall CSS bundle size
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Cleaner CSS file with only necessary utility classes
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Removal of empty directories reduces project complexity
4. **Better Developer Experience**: Cleaner codebase with fewer unused assets to navigate

## 4. Verification

- Confirmed that removed directories were empty and unused
- Confirmed that removed CSS classes were marked as unused in comments
- No build errors or runtime issues introduced by these removals
