### 1. Deprecated Redundant Form Styles

- **Changes**: Deprecated the file and removed all form-related CSS classes (.form-input, .form-label, .form-select, etc.) since they are now implemented in dedicated UI components

  - Container query classes (.container-query, .container-card, etc.)

- **Reason**: These classes were not used anywhere in the project

### 3. Optimized Critical CSS

All CSS classes and components that were removed were verified to be unused in the project by searching through all files. The remaining CSS files and components are properly organized and do not contain duplicates.

The project structure is now cleaner with reduced bundle size and improved maintainability.
