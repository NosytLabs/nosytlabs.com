        await this.handleProcessingError(err, context);
      }
    });
  }

  async processManufacturingData(data) {
    // Validate and transform sensor data
    const processedData = this.validateAndTransform(data);
    
    // Check for anomalies
    const anomalies = await this.detectAnomalies(processedData);
    
    // Store in database
    await this.storeData(processedData);
    
    // Trigger alerts if necessary
