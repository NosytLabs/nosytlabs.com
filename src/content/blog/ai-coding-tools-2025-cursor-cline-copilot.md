- Rate limit issues: **Frequent during public preview**

### Pricing
- **Free during preview** – Full access
- **Coming soon** – Team and Enterprise plans ($TBD)

### Verdict
**Most innovative, most unpolished.** Antigravity is genuinely transformative but still in public preview. Rate limits, occasional model errors, and slowness during peak hours. Will be the most powerful once enterprise features launch.
