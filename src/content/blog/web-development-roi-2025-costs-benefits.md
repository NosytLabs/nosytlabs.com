## 8. FAQ: Web Development Investment

This usually means:

3. **Wrong audience** – Need better targeting

Start with MVP (minimum viable product). Add features based on actual user behavior and business needs. This saves money and reduces waste on features nobody uses.

### How much ongoing maintenance?
- Monthly: Software updates, security patches ($50-200)
- Quarterly: Content updates and optimization ($100-500)
- Yearly: Major overhauls or feature additions ($500-2,000)

### Custom vs no-code platforms?

- **Custom:** Slower to launch, unlimited customization, better scalability, higher cost

Choose based on your business complexity.
