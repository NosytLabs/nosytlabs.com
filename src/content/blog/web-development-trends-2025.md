- **Predictive development** that suggests features based on user behavior patterns
- **Natural language programming** interfaces for non-technical stakeholders

### AI-Driven Architecture

```javascript
// AI-optimized component generation
const SmartComponent = await AI.generateComponent({
  purpose: 'user dashboard',
  data: userMetrics,
  accessibility: 'WCAG 2.2 AAA',
  performance: 'sub-100ms render',
});
```

## Quantum-Ready Web Applications

Quantum computing is transitioning from research to practical applications:

### Sustainable UX Patterns

```css
/* Energy-efficient animations */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .efficient-animation {
    animation: fade-in 0.3s ease-out;
    will-change: opacity;
  }
}

/* Dark mode for energy savings */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --bg-color: var(--color-neutral-900);
    --text-color: var(--color-neutral-0);
  }
}
```
