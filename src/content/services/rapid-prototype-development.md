Validate your idea fast with a working prototype or MVP. Test with real users, get feedback, and make informed decisions before investing in full development.

## Why Build a Prototype First?

### Test Before You Invest

Building a full app can cost $30,000-$150,000+. A prototype costs $5,000-$20,000 and tells you if your idea works.

**What You Learn**:
- Do people actually want this?
- What features matter most?
- What's confusing or broken?
- Is the concept viable?

### Get Funding

Investors want to see something working, not just slides. A prototype shows you're serious and capable.

**Prototype vs Pitch Deck**:
- Pitch deck alone: "Interesting idea, come back when you have traction"
- Working prototype: "Let's talk numbers"

### Speed to Market

Launch in weeks, not months. Test your concept while competitors are still planning.

**Timeline Comparison**:
- Full app development: 3-6 months
- Prototype/MVP: 2-4 weeks
- Time saved: 2-5 months

## What We Build

### Clickable Prototypes

Interactive mockups that look and feel like a real app. Perfect for user testing and investor demos.

**What's Included**:
- 5-10 key screens designed
- Clickable navigation between screens
- Basic interactions (buttons, forms)
- Mobile or web responsive
- Shareable link for testing

**Pricing**: $5,000-$8,000
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks

### Functional MVPs

Real working apps with core features only. Users can actually use it, not just click through.

**What's Included**:
- User authentication (login/signup)
- 1-3 core features working
- Basic database and backend
- Deployed and accessible online
- Ready for real user testing

**Pricing**: $10,000-$25,000
**Timeline**: 3-6 weeks

### Landing Page + Waitlist

Test demand before building anything. See if people actually want your product.

**What's Included**:
- Professional landing page
- Email capture form
- Analytics tracking
- Social proof elements
- Mobile responsive

**Pricing**: $2,000-$4,000
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks

## Our Process

### Week 1: Define & Design
- Clarify the core concept
- Identify must-have features
- Create wireframes and flow
- Design key screens

### Week 2-3: Build
- Develop core functionality
- Implement key features
- Set up hosting/deployment
- Basic testing

### Week 4: Test & Iterate
- User testing sessions
- Gather feedback
- Quick fixes and tweaks
- Final delivery

## What Happens After?

Once you have a working prototype, you have three clear paths forward:

**Option 1: Pivot or Kill It** - If testing shows the idea doesn't work, you saved $50,000+ by finding out early.

**Option 2: Raise Funding** - Use the prototype to pitch investors. Much easier with something working.

**Option 3: Build the Full Product** - We can take the prototype and build it into a full production app. You already know what works.
