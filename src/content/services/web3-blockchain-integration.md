Practical Web3 integration for modern applications. Connect wallets, interact with smart contracts, and build blockchain features without the hype—just solid technical implementation.

## What We Can Build

### Wallet Connection & Authentication

Add Web3 wallet login to your application.

**What's Included**:
- MetaMask and WalletConnect integration
- User authentication via wallet signatures
- Profile management tied to wallet address
- Multi-chain support

**Pricing**: $2,500-$4,000
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Use Cases**: dApps, token-gated platforms, NFT communities

### Smart Contract Integration

Connect your app to existing smart contracts.

**What's Included**:
- Read and write contract functions
- Transaction signing and submission
- Contract event monitoring
- Error handling and user feedback

**Pricing**: $3,000-$6,000
**Timeline**: 3-5 weeks
**Use Cases**: Decentralized finance (DeFi), token platforms, governance

### NFT Integration & Management

Add NFT display, minting, and management to your app.

**What's Included**:
- NFT display and metadata fetching
- Minting functionality
- Wallet integration for NFT transfers
- Gallery and collection management
- Marketplace integration (optional)

**Pricing**: $4,000-$8,000
**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks
**Use Cases**: NFT marketplaces, digital collectibles, creator platforms

### Token & Cryptocurrency Features

Build payment and transaction features with tokens.

**What's Included**:
- Token balance display and management
- Swap integration (Uniswap, others)
- Staking functionality
- Transaction history and analytics
- Multi-chain payment support

**Pricing**: $5,000-$10,000
**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks
**Use Cases**: Token gating, payment platforms, DeFi applications

## Supported Blockchains

- **Ethereum** - Primary smart contract platform
- **Polygon** - Low-cost, high-speed alternative
- **Arbitrum** - Layer 2 scaling solution
- **Optimism** - Efficient Layer 2 network
- **Base** - Coinbase's Layer 2 solution
- **Other EVM chains** - Custom support available

## Technology Stack

- **Web3.js** or **Ethers.js** - Blockchain interaction
- **MetaMask SDK** - Wallet connectivity
- **WalletConnect** - Multi-wallet support
- **Wagmi** - React hooks for Web3
- **Hardhat/Foundry** - Smart contract tools (if needed)
- **Solidity** - Smart contract development (if needed)

## What This Requires

### From You

- Understanding of blockchain basics (or willingness to learn)
- Existing smart contracts OR we can help design them
- Clear requirements for user interactions
- Test tokens/testnet setup for development

### From Us

- Deep knowledge of Ethereum and EVM chains
- Experience with wallet standards and security
- Smart contract interaction patterns
- Transaction handling and gas optimization

## Important Considerations

**Security**: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. We implement:
- Input validation and error handling
- User confirmation prompts for transactions
- Testnet-first development and testing
- Security best practices review

**Cost Management**: 
- Gas fees vary by network (Polygon is cheaper than Ethereum)
- We optimize for cost-efficiency
- Clear recommendations on which chain to use

**User Experience**:
- Wallet connection flows are confusing—we make them simple
- Clear transaction status feedback
- Error messages that help users understand what went wrong

## Not Building?

- ICOs or token launches (regulatory complexity)
- Anonymous payment processing (regulatory concerns)
- Yield farming or complex financial instruments (requires expertise)
- High-frequency trading systems

For these, we'd recommend consulting with blockchain lawyers and financial advisors first.

## Getting Started

Tell us:
- What blockchain feature do you need?
- Do you already have smart contracts?
- What user experience are you aiming for?
- What's your timeline?

We'll discuss technical feasibility, costs, and blockchain choice, then provide a detailed quote.

Web3 integration that's practical, secure, and user-friendly.
