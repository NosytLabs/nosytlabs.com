## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this real music or just AI noise?**
A: Suno AI generates high-quality, professional-sounding music with vocals, instruments, and proper song structure. Listen to examples on Spotify to hear the quality.

**Q: Can I use this commercially?**
A: Yes! All projects include full commercial usage rights. Use in ads, monetized content, business applications - anywhere.

**Q: What if I don't like what you create?**
A: We keep refining until you're satisfied. Most projects include multiple rounds of revisions to get it exactly right.

**Q: How is this different from stock music?**
A: Stock music is generic and used by thousands. Your custom tracks are unique to you - no one else has them.

**Q: Can you match a specific song's style?**
A: We can create music inspired by styles and vibes, but not exact copies of copyrighted songs. Think "upbeat like Daft Punk" not "copy Get Lucky."
