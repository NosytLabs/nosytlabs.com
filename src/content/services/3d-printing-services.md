## What We Print

### Functional Prototypes
Test your designs before committing to expensive manufacturing. Perfect for product development and proof-of-concept.

**Materials Available**:
- **PLA** - Standard, biodegradable, great for prototypes (prints at 200-220°C)
- **PETG** - Stronger, more durable, food-safe (prints at 230-250°C)
- **ABS** - Heat resistant, tough (prints at 240-260°C)
- **TPU** - Flexible, rubber-like (prints at 220-240°C)
- **ASA** - Outdoor use, UV resistant (prints at 240-260°C)
- **Wood-fill** - Aesthetic finish, CNC-like appearance

**Typical Pricing**: $25-$150 depending on size and complexity
**Tolerances**: ±0.2mm standard, ±0.1mm for precision parts

### Custom Parts & Replacements
Need a replacement part that's no longer available? Custom brackets? Unique tools? We can print it.

**Common Requests**:
- Replacement parts for appliances/equipment
- Custom mounting brackets and adapters
- Jigs and fixtures for workshops
- Enclosures for electronics projects
- Prototype housings for products

**Example**: Custom mounting bracket that would cost $200+ from a machine shop - printed for $35 in 2 days.

### Small Batch Production
Need 10-100 of something? 3D printing is more cost-effective than traditional manufacturing for small runs.

**Perfect For**:
- Product launches (test market before mass production)
- Limited edition items
- Custom merchandise
- Replacement parts inventory
- Event giveaways

### Scale Models & Presentations
High-detail models for presentations, planning, and client visualization.

**Materials**: High-detail printing for smooth finishes
**Capabilities**: Multi-color printing, transparent materials, fine details down to 0.1mm

## Design & Engineering Support

### Design Optimization for 3D Printing
We review your designs and optimize them for 3D printing on our Creality Ender Neo printers, ensuring printability while maintaining functionality.

**Common Optimizations**:
- Support structure minimization
- Wall thickness optimization
- Overhang angle adjustments
- Print orientation selection for quality and speed
- Material selection for your use case

### Material Selection Consulting
Choose the right material for your application based on:
- Mechanical properties needed
- Environmental requirements
- Cost considerations
- Temperature resistance needed
- Flexibility vs. rigidity requirements

### Reverse Engineering
Don't have CAD files? We can create them from physical parts, sketches, or photos.

**Process**:
1. 3D scanning or manual measurement
2. CAD model creation
3. Design optimization
4. Test print and validation
