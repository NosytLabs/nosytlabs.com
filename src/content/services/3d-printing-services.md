Professional 3D printing and prototyping services for product development, custom parts, and rapid iteration. Fast turnaround, quality prints, and competitive pricing.

## What We Print

### Functional Prototypes

Test your designs before committing to expensive manufacturing. Perfect for product development and proof-of-concept.

**Materials Available**:
- PLA (standard, biodegradable, great for prototypes)
- PETG (stronger, more durable, food-safe)
- ABS (heat resistant, tough)
- TPU (flexible, rubber-like)
- ASA (outdoor use, UV resistant)

**Typical Pricing**: $25-$150 depending on size and complexity
**Tolerances**: ±0.2mm standard, ±0.1mm for precision parts

### Custom Parts & Replacements

Need a replacement part that's no longer available? Custom brackets? Unique tools? We can print it.

**Common Requests**:
- Replacement parts for appliances/equipment
- Custom mounting brackets and adapters
- Jigs and fixtures for workshops
- Enclosures for electronics projects
- Prototype housings for products

**Example**: Custom mounting bracket that would cost $200+ from a machine shop - printed for $35 in 2 days.

### Small Batch Production

Need 10-100 of something? 3D printing can be more cost-effective than traditional manufacturing for small runs.

**Perfect For**:
- Product launches (test market before mass production)
- Limited edition items
- Custom merchandise
- Replacement parts inventory
- Event giveaways

Scale models for presentations, planning, and client visualization.

**Materials**: High-detail resin printing for smooth finishes
**Capabilities**: Multi-color printing, transparent materials, fine details down to 0.1mm

## Our 3D Printing Capabilities

### FDM Printing (Fused Deposition Modeling)

- **Build Volume**: Up to 300x300x400mm
- **Layer Height**: 0.1mm to 0.3mm
- **Materials**: PLA, PETG, ABS, TPU, ASA, Wood-fill, Metal-fill
- **Best For**: Functional parts, large prototypes, durable components

### SLA Printing (Stereolithography)

- **Build Volume**: Up to 192x120x200mm
- **Layer Height**: 0.01mm to 0.1mm
- **Materials**: Standard resin, tough resin, flexible resin, castable resin
- **Best For**: High-detail parts, smooth finishes, miniatures

### Post-Processing Services

- **Sanding & Finishing**: Smooth surface finishes
- **Painting & Coating**: Custom colors and protective coatings
- **Assembly**: Multi-part assemblies and hardware installation
- **Quality Control**: Dimensional verification and testing

## Design & Engineering Support

### Design Optimization for 3D Printing

We review your designs and optimize them for 3D printing, ensuring printability while maintaining functionality.

**Common Optimizations**:

- Support structure minimization
- Wall thickness optimization
- Overhang angle adjustments
- Print orientation selection

### Reverse Engineering

Don't have CAD files? We can create them from physical parts, sketches, or photos.

**Process**:

1. 3D scanning or manual measurement
2. CAD model creation
3. Design optimization
4. Test print and validation

### Material Selection Consulting

Choose the right material for your application based on mechanical properties, environmental requirements, and cost considerations.

## Real Project Examples

### Medical Device Prototype

**Challenge**: Startup needed functional prototypes for FDA testing
**Solution**: High-precision SLA printing with biocompatible resin
**Result**: 15 iterations completed in 3 weeks, successful FDA submission

### Industrial Tooling

**Challenge**: Manufacturing line needed custom jigs and fixtures
**Solution**: Durable ABS printing with reinforcement design
**Result**: $15,000 in tooling costs reduced to $800, 2-week delivery vs 8 weeks

### Architectural Presentation Model

**Challenge**: Architecture firm needed detailed building model for client presentation
**Solution**: Multi-material printing with transparent windows and detailed landscaping
**Result**: Client approved design immediately, project moved to construction phase

## Pricing & Timeline

### Standard Turnaround

- **Simple parts**: 1-3 business days
- **Complex assemblies**: 3-7 business days
- **Large or high-detail parts**: 5-10 business days
