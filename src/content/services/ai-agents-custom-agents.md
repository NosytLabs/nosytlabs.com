Autonomous AI agents that work for you 24/7. Unlike traditional chatbots that just answer questions, our AI agents actively plan, execute, and optimize complex workflows using Claude, Gemini 3 Pro, or OpenAI's latest models.

## What AI Agents Can Do

### Workflow Automation Agents

Agents that manage entire business processes end-to-end.

**Examples:**
- Customer support escalation and resolution
- Lead qualification and outreach campaigns
- Invoice processing and payment reconciliation
- Content moderation and categorization
- Inventory management and reordering

**Pricing**: $10,000-$20,000
**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks
**Impact**: Automate 40-60 hours/week of work

### Research & Analysis Agents

Agents that gather, analyze, and synthesize information autonomously.

**Use Cases:**
- Market research and competitor analysis
- Financial data aggregation and reporting
- Scientific literature review and synthesis
- Real estate market analysis
- Trend analysis and forecasting

**Pricing**: $12,000-$25,000
**Timeline**: 5-10 weeks
**Capability**: Process thousands of sources automatically

### Code & Development Agents

Agents powered by Google Antigravity or similar that write, test, and deploy code.

**Applications:**
- Automated bug fixing and code optimization
- Testing suite generation and execution
- API documentation generation
- Database schema design and migrations
- Frontend component generation

**Pricing**: $15,000-$30,000
**Timeline**: 6-12 weeks
**Output**: Production-ready code with tests

### Multi-Agent Systems

Coordinate multiple specialized agents working in parallel.

**Architecture:**
- Orchestrator agent that delegates tasks
- Specialist agents (writing, analysis, coding, etc.)
- Artifact-based communication
- Asynchronous workflow coordination

**Pricing**: $20,000-$50,000+
**Timeline**: 8-16 weeks
**Capability**: Complex, multi-domain automation

## Technology Stack

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Advanced reasoning and planning
- **Gemini 3 Pro** - State-of-the-art model with agentic capabilities
- **OpenAI GPT-4.5** - High-performance alternative
- **Google Antigravity** - Agent orchestration platform
- **Vertex AI** - Enterprise deployment platform
- **Custom API integrations** - Connect to your existing systems

## How It Works

### 1. Agent Design & Planning
- Define agent goals and constraints
- Map required tools and integrations
- Design decision-making logic
- Plan artifact generation

### 2. Agent Development
- Implement agent architecture
- Build tool integrations
- Create monitoring and logging
- Set up error handling and fallbacks

### 3. Training & Optimization
- Provide knowledge base and context
- Fine-tune decision-making
- Test edge cases and scenarios
- Optimize performance

### 4. Deployment & Monitoring
- Deploy to production environment
- Set up continuous monitoring
- Create feedback loops
- Iterate and improve

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Support Agent
An agent that handles 80% of customer support without human intervention:
- Reads customer email
- Searches knowledge base
- Generates response
- Routes to human if needed
- Tracks resolution

**Result**: 30+ hours/week saved

### Example 2: Research Agent
Autonomous research agent that monitors news and generates reports:
- Crawls 50+ news sources daily
- Extracts relevant information
- Synthesizes into structured reports
- Identifies trends and anomalies
- Alerts on critical findings

**Result**: 20 hours/week research work eliminated

### Example 3: Data Processing Agent
Agent that handles recurring data pipeline work:
- Retrieves data from multiple APIs
- Cleans and normalizes data
- Runs analysis and calculations
- Generates visualizations
- Updates dashboards

**Result**: Fully automated, 15+ hours/week saved

## Getting Started

Tell us:
- What workflow or process would you like to automate?
- How much manual work is involved currently?
- What systems does it need to integrate with?
- What decisions does the agent need to make?

We'll design a custom agent system and provide a detailed implementation plan.

Autonomous AI agents that scale your business beyond human limitations.
