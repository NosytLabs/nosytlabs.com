**Timeline**: 3-6 weeks

### Mobile Applications
- Cross-platform React Native apps
- TypeScript implementation
- Full testing and optimization
- App store deployment ready

**Price Range**: $12,000-$30,000
**Timeline**: 4-8 weeks

### Automation & Integration Systems
- API integrations between systems
- Workflow automation
- Data processing pipelines
- Custom business logic

**Price Range**: $5,000-$15,000
**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks

## How AI Code Generation Works

1. **Requirements Definition** - We define exactly what you need
2. **Prompt Engineering** - Create detailed prompts for AI models
3. **AI Generation** - Claude/GPT-4 generates code
4. **Review & Refinement** - We review and optimize quality
5. **Testing** - Automated tests generated and run
6. **Deployment** - Production-ready application delivered

## Real Productivity Impact

- **Traditional development**: 200 hours → $20K cost
- **AI-assisted development**: 60 hours → $8K cost
- **Time saved**: 140 hours (70% reduction)
- **Cost saved**: $12K (60% reduction)

## Why AI Code Generation?

✅ Faster delivery (10x speedier)
✅ Lower costs (60% cheaper)
✅ Better quality (AI handles boilerplate perfectly)
✅ Less technical debt
✅ Easier to maintain
