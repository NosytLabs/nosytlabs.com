Cross-platform mobile apps built with React Native - one codebase that works on both iOS and Android. Using AI tools to code faster while maintaining quality and performance.

## Why React Native?

### One Codebase, Two Platforms

Write once, deploy to both iOS and Android. Saves time and money compared to building separate native apps.

**Cost Comparison**:
- Native development (separate iOS + Android): $40,000-$150,000+
- React Native (cross-platform): $15,000-$70,000
- Savings: 40-60% on development costs

### Near-Native Performance

React Native apps feel like native apps. Smooth animations, fast load times, and access to device features.

**What You Get**:
- Native UI components (looks like a real iOS/Android app)
- 60fps animations and transitions
- Access to camera, GPS, notifications, etc.
- Offline functionality
- App store ready

### Faster Development with AI

Using Claude, Cursor, and modern AI tools to code faster without sacrificing quality.

**Timeline**:
- Simple app (3-5 screens): 6-8 weeks
- Medium app (10-15 screens): 8-12 weeks  
- Complex app (20+ screens, integrations): 12-16 weeks

## What We Build

### Business Apps

Internal tools, employee apps, field service apps, inventory management.

**Example**: Field service app for tracking jobs, time, and customer info - $18,000, 8 weeks.

### Consumer Apps

Social features, user profiles, content feeds, messaging.

**Example**: Community app with profiles, posts, and chat - $25,000, 10 weeks.

### E-commerce Apps

Product catalogs, shopping carts, payment processing, order tracking.

**Example**: Small business shop app with Stripe integration - $22,000, 10 weeks.

### On-Demand Services

Booking systems, real-time tracking, notifications, payments.

**Example**: Appointment booking app with calendar and reminders - $20,000, 9 weeks.
