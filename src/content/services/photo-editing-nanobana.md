Simple, honest photo editing. Send us your photos with what you want changed, and we'll make them look better. Perfect for e-commerce, social media, or any visual content.

## What We Can Do

### Background Changes
Replace or improve backgrounds.

- **White/neutral backgrounds** for product listings
- **Simple color backgrounds** (solid colors, gradients)
- **Remove clutter** from busy backgrounds
- **Blur backgrounds** to focus on subject

**Price**: $20-30 per photo
**Turnaround**: 2-3 days
**Honest Note**: Complex backgrounds take longer. Simple changes are fastest.

### Color & Lighting Fixes
Make photos look better with better colors and lighting.

- Fix dark or washed-out photos
- Correct white balance (fix weird color casts)
- Brighten shadows, tone down bright spots
- Increase color vibrancy or mute tones

**Price**: $15-25 per photo
**Turnaround**: 1-2 days
**Honest Note**: We work with what you give us. Great original photos = better results.

### Remove Unwanted Objects
Take out things you don't want in the photo.

- Remove people, animals, or objects
- Clean up messy backgrounds
- Remove text or logos
- Delete photobombers

**Price**: $25-40 depending on difficulty
**Turnaround**: 2-3 days
**Honest Note**: Simple removals are quick. Complex stuff takes longer and may need touchup.

### Add Text to Images
Add text for social media, ads, or graphics.

- Simple text overlays
- Social media captions
- Promotional text
- Basic graphic design text

**Price**: $20-35 per image
**Turnaround**: 1-2 days
**Honest Note**: Basic text placement only. Complex design layouts cost more.

### Product Photography Touch-Up
Enhance product photos for e-commerce.

- Clean up shadows and lighting
- Standardize background
- Fix color accuracy
- Remove dust, wrinkles, or flaws

**Price**: $20-30 per product photo
**Turnaround**: 2-3 days
**Honest Note**: We enhance photos you provide. Great source photo = better results.

## How It Works

**1. You Send**:
- Photo (JPG or PNG)
- What you want changed (e.g., "remove background," "brighten photo," "fix colors")

**2. We Edit**:
- Make the changes you requested
- Send you a preview

**3. You Review**:
- Check the preview
- Ask for adjustments (2 free revisions included)

**4. You Receive**:
- Final edited photo
- Ready to use

## What We Won't Promise

We're honest about what we can and can't do:

- **Can't fix blurry photos** - if it's out of focus, we can't fix that
- **Can't do complex compositing** - blending multiple photos requires more skill
- **Can't recreate missing parts** - if something isn't in the photo, we can't invent it
- **One major change per order** - background change OR color fix, not both (choose one)
- **Text is basic placement** - not fancy design typography
