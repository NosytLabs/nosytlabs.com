**Honest Note**: We build straightforward business websites. Very custom designs take longer.

### Service-Based Sites

- Case studies (optional)
- Contact and inquiry forms

**Scope**: 5-8 pages

**Honest Note**: We focus on conversion and clarity, not fancy animations.

### Portfolio Websites

**Scope**: 6-12 pages
**Price**: $500-1,200
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Honest Note**: We create clean, professional portfolios. Gallery sites require good photos from you.

## What's Included

✅ Custom website design (no templates)

## What We Use

- **Astro** - Fast, modern web framework
- **React** - For interactive features when needed
- **TypeScript** - For reliable, maintainable code
- **Tailwind CSS** - For professional styling
- **Mobile-first design** - Works on phones first

## Honest Limitations

We're straightforward about what we can do:

- **No complex applications** - if you need a full app with user accounts, that's different pricing
- **No eCommerce setup** - we can build a store structure, but payment processing is separate
- **No high-end animations** - we focus on clean, professional sites
- **Your content needed** - you provide text and images; we build the site
- **One revision round per section** - communicate clearly during design
